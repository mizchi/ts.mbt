# TODO

The wasm interpreter / codegen / AOT compiler that originally lived in this
repo has been removed. Items below are scoped to the bridge generator only.

## Interop Bridge Quality Roadmap: 60% -> 90%

Current assessment: the project is around 55-60% complete as a practical
`TypeScript <-> MoonBit` interoperability bridge. It is usable for selected
packages under supervision, but not yet reliable enough for arbitrary npm or
MoonBit packages without inspection.

Target: reach about 90% practical quality for the declared supported surface.
This does not mean "all TypeScript semantics"; it means generated bridges are
predictable, self-diagnosing, build-backed, and runnable for a broad real-world
corpus without manual edits.

### 90% Quality Gate

- [x] `just ci` passes with all fixture-backed bridge/scaffold checks.
- [x] `just verify-realworld-typescript` passes with a fixed corpus of at least
  20 npm / Node entrypoints.
- [x] `just verify-realworld-moonbit` passes with a fixed corpus of at least 15
  local MoonBit packages.
- [x] Every generated TS -> MoonBit package in the real-world corpus passes:
  `moon check --target js`, `moon test --target js`, `moon build --target js`,
  and a Node smoke run.
- [x] Every generated MoonBit -> TS package in the real-world corpus passes:
  `moon build --target js`, TypeScript declaration typecheck, and a Node import
  smoke run for root and subpath exports.
- [x] Unsupported exports are either 0 or limited to explicitly-budgeted
  ambiguous surfaces with actionable diagnostics.
  - `just bridge-quality` now fails on unbudgeted unsupported exports and
    budgets only the single fixture-backed ambiguous re-export surface with
    explicit candidate diagnostics.
  - `just verify-realworld-typescript` also budgets the single zod
    `ZodFirstPartyTypeKind` empty compatibility enum stub as an omitted,
    runtime-safe unsupported surface.
- [x] `JSValue` usage is classified by reason, and budgets are stable per
  package instead of being treated as an opaque quality number.
  - Real-world TypeScript metrics now split `JSValue` surface usage into
    unknown / any, overload, conditional / mapped, callback / function,
    tuple / array, and namespace / value buckets, with per-package budgets.
- [x] Generated packages require no manual glue edits for the supported corpus.
  - Real-world TypeScript verification hashes generated glue files immediately
    after CLI generation and fails if smoke setup or builds mutate them.
  - Real-world MoonBit verification hashes generated package artifacts and
    fails if typecheck, import smoke, or consumer smoke steps mutate them.
- [x] `README.md` documents the supported surface, unsupported surface, and
  diagnostic interpretation clearly enough for external users.
  - README now documents the supported MoonBit -> TypeScript and TypeScript ->
    MoonBit bridge surfaces, known fallbacks, diagnostics files, quality
    reports, and the no-arbitrary-package-conversion caveat.

### Generated Code Review Follow-up (2026-05-01)

Review status:

- `just verify-examples` passes, including JS build smokes.
- `just bridge-quality` passes with 0 unbudgeted unsupported exports.
- `just verify-realworld-typescript` passes with package-local `JSValue` cause
  budgets and warning-free MoonBit checks.
- A node:fs-only real-world probe builds and runs with 0 unsupported exports.
  Current metrics after callback/option-bag, generic, tuple, and function-type
  cleanup: 2239 bridge lines, 327 declared functions, 12 `JSValue` refs, 2
  `JSValue` functions, and 11 `JSValue` surface lines.

Next implementation tasks:

- [x] Fix callable interface conversion at the JS boundary.
  - Current symptom: React `forwardRef` receives an object converted from
    `ForwardRefRenderFunction` instead of a callable JS function, producing
    `forwardRef requires a render function but was given object.`
  - Target: generated converters for interfaces with a `<call>` / `_call_`
    signature should pass through existing JS functions and wrap MoonBit
    records as callable JS functions while preserving optional properties.
  - Done: `ffi_struct_js_converter_decl` now emits callable wrappers for
    `<call>` interfaces, and the React examples no longer emit the runtime
    `forwardRef` warning.
- [x] Remove package-global opaque generic placeholders such as `type T`,
  `type P`, and `type S` from generated public APIs.
  - Target: preserve representable generics as MoonBit type parameters; if a
    TypeScript generic cannot be represented safely, widen only that local
    boundary to `JSValue` with diagnostics.
  - Done: interface type parameters are preserved in the AST and local generic
    placeholders are widened at the specific boundary instead of emitted as
    package-global opaque types; generated Hono/React/TypeScript AST examples no
    longer leak `type T` / `type P` style placeholders.
- [x] Lower or explicitly budget remaining anonymous literal-union public
  surfaces.
  - Current unbudgeted examples include React `OlHTMLAttributes`, Vitest
    `Assertion` / `VitestUtils` / `SerializedConfig`, and TypeScript AST
    `UserPreferences` / encoded classification request args.
  - Target: create stable synthetic names when a public owner can be inferred,
    otherwise keep the fallback but require an explicit budget and diagnostic.
  - Done: anonymous string literal unions now get stable synthetic enum names
    even when literal values are unsafe as MoonBit case names or appear inside
    function/object/union surfaces. `just bridge-quality` now has 0 unbudgeted
    unsupported exports.
- [x] Reduce node:fs JSValue regressions.
  - Previous node:fs metrics: 2015 bridge lines, 312 declared functions,
    117 JSValue refs, 81 JSValue functions, 0 unsupported exports.
  - Priority: callback aliases, overload-selected sync/promisify wrappers, and
    common option bag aliases such as stat/read/write options.
  - Done: inline callback parameters now receive stable synthetic callback
    opaque types instead of `JSValue`, and named option intersections such as
    `StatOptions & { bigint?: false }` collapse back to the named option bag;
    `StatsBase<T>` / `StatsFsBase<T>` now preserve `T`, and event-map tuple
    payloads keep `Array[Unit]`, `Array[Double]`, or `Array[Error_]` where
    representable. Function types now lower to MoonBit function arrows instead
    of `JSValue`; inline `Promise<{ ... }>` results such as
    `read.__promisify__` / `write.__promisify__` now get named result structs,
    and class method generic bounds keep stream listener event names as
    `String`. Common `writeFile*` / `appendFile*` string data and `cp*` string
    paths now stay typed; `glob*` string patterns and `create*Stream` option
    bags are preserved; promisify file-data wrappers no longer widen string
    data to `JSValue`; stream `path` properties now use `PathLike`, and
    `StatSyncFn` callable options use `StatSyncOptions?`. Stream listener
    payloads now use generated payload opaque types, and redundant
    encoding-dependent overload wrappers with wider returns are skipped.
    `BigIntStats` nanosecond fields now lower to `Int64`, and
    `FSWatcherEventMap.change` uses an opaque payload type instead of
    `Array[JSValue]`; `WatchOptions.encoding` now lowers to `String?`.
    Overload wrapper pruning keeps narrow overloads per arity, so the broad
    `fstatSync` / `statfsSync` union-return wrappers no longer leak `JSValue`
    while bigint variants remain callable. `readFileSync` /
    `readFile.__promisify__` buffer options now use `ReadFileBufferOptions?`,
    `readFileSync` also exposes a `BufferEncoding -> String` wrapper, broad
    `globSync` union-return wrappers are skipped, and `_GlobOptions.cwd`,
    `_GlobOptions.exclude`, and `CopyOptions.filter` now keep concrete MoonBit
    types. Current node:fs budget is 11 `JSValue` surface lines and 2
    `JSValue` functions.
  - Remaining quality debt: event payloads with heterogeneous values still use
    opaque payload boundaries, and custom `fs` implementation hooks / watcher
    ignore predicates still require `JSValue`.
- [x] Split large generated MoonBit packages into reviewable files.
  - Target layout: `types.mbt`, `externs.mbt`, `converters.mbt`, and
    `guards.mbt` for large TS -> MoonBit scaffolds, while preserving generated
    `bridge.mbti` and package metadata.
  - Done: generated TS -> MoonBit packages over the review threshold now split
    MoonBit implementation code into `types.mbt`, `converters.mbt`,
    `externs.mbt`, `guards.mbt`, and `bridge.mbt`. Example/scaffold checks,
    real-world manifests, and bridge quality metrics now count the split source
    files instead of assuming all implementation code lives in `bridge.mbt`.
- [x] Add regression rails for generated-code ergonomics.
  - [x] React `forwardRef` warning should fail the smoke rail.
  - [x] TypeScript AST transformer smoke should reduce required `unsafeCast`
    usage around `ScriptTarget`, `transform`, visitors, and transformed arrays.
  - [x] node:fs budget regressions should fail with package-local diagnostics.

### Package-Specific Practical Coverage Pass (2026-05-01)

Implemented in the current real-world TypeScript probe order:

- [x] Small Node built-ins now target zero public `JSValue` fallback.
  - `node:path`, `node:os`, `node:url`, `node:querystring`, and `node:buffer`
    all generate with `JSValue surface = 0` in
    `_build/realworld-typescript/METRICS.md`.
  - The corresponding real-world budgets in
    `scripts/verify_realworld_typescript.sh` are fixed at 0 so regressions fail.
- [x] `node:crypto` focused pass.
  - Common option bags, AAD options, key-like parameters, WebCrypto algorithm
    parameters, `generateKeyPair` callbacks, and broad `generatePrimeSync`
    overloads are now specialized or pruned.
  - Current `node:crypto` metrics: `JSValue refs = 0`, `JSValue functions = 0`,
    `JSValue surface = 0`.
- [x] Hono practical route API smoke.
  - The real-world smoke now writes a route as
    `app.hono_get("/", realworld_hono_handler)`.
  - Route paths lower to `String`, handlers lower to `(Context) -> Response`,
    and common `Context` response helpers such as `text` return `Response`.
  - Current Hono budget is tightened to 55 `JSValue` surface lines and 36
    `JSValue` functions; remaining fallbacks are mostly generic context,
    router, and validation data surfaces.
- [x] Zod / Valibot / Preact fallback policy documented.
  - These packages remain buildable and smoke-tested, but their high-order
    schema, parser, JSX, and component generic surfaces are explicitly
    documented as budgeted `JSValue` fallback areas rather than natural MoonBit
    APIs.
- [x] Split real-world packages into explicit fallback policy classes.
  - `just verify-realworld-typescript` now appends a fallback policy table to
    `_build/realworld-typescript/METRICS.md` and fails if a new corpus package
    is not classified.
  - Active naturalization targets: Hono, React Router, JOSE, Glob, `date-fns`,
    `magic-string`, `source-map`, `node:sqlite`, `node:fs`, `node:assert`, and
    `node:util`.
  - Budgeted fallback probes: Zod, Valibot, Preact, and broad Playwright
    event/callback surfaces. These should stay buildable and smoke-tested, but
    are not currently claimed as naturally typed MoonBit APIs.
- [x] Add a first Glob naturalization for function-valued const exports.
  - `declare const hasMagic: (pattern: string | string[], options:
    GlobOptions) => boolean` now keeps the existing getter but also emits a
    MoonBit string-subset wrapper as `has_magic(pattern : String, options :
    GlobOptions) -> Bool`.
  - Function-valued const exports whose signatures do not widen to `@js.Any`
    also get direct callable wrappers, so `escape(pattern, options)` and
    `unescape(pattern, options)` no longer require `get_escape()` /
    `get_unescape()` first.
  - The real-world Glob smoke now calls `escape`, `unescape`, and
    `has_magic("src/*.mbt", options)` directly instead of manufacturing a
    `JSValue` pattern argument or calling getter-returned functions.
  - The Hono real-world example smoke now uses a typed MoonBit route handler
    `(Context) -> Response` directly with `app.get("/hello", handler)`.

### Phase 1: Measurement and Diagnostics (60% -> 65%)

- [x] Add a persistent quality score report for bridge generation.
  - Include generated lines, exported declarations, unsupported exports,
    `JSValue` refs, `JSValue` functions, runtime smoke coverage, and diagnostics.
  - Initial fixture-backed report is generated by `just bridge-quality` at
    `_build/bridge-quality/REPORT.md`.
- [x] Split `JSValue` metrics by cause:
  - unknown / any
  - overload fallback
  - conditional / mapped type fallback
  - callback / function type fallback
  - tuple / array fallback
  - namespace / value fallback
  - Initial breakdown is heuristic over generated `bridge.mbti` surface lines
    in `just bridge-quality`.
  - Real-world TypeScript verification uses the same buckets in
    `_build/realworld-typescript/METRICS.md` and fails on unbudgeted growth.
- [x] Make `SCAFFOLD_DIAGNOSTICS.md` explain what was widened, omitted, or
  bridge-wrapped, and whether each item is runtime-safe.
  - Diagnostics now include a summary table with decision, reason, runtime
    safety, and a decision vocabulary for widened / omitted / bridge-wrapped
    surfaces.
- [x] Add a `just bridge-quality` task that runs the fixture corpus and prints a
  single summary table.
- [x] Store real-world corpus package versions / paths in one config file so the
  score is reproducible across machines.
  - TypeScript real-world corpus entries now live in
    `corpus/realworld-typescript.tsv`; `scripts/verify_realworld_typescript.sh`
    records that path in `METRICS.md`.

### Phase 2: TypeScript -> MoonBit Surface Coverage (65% -> 72%)

- [x] Harden npm / Node type resolution:
  - [x] package `exports`
  - [x] `types` / `typings`
  - [x] subpath exports
  - [x] `typesVersions`
  - [x] `@types/*` fallback
  - [x] `node:*` built-in modules
  - Resolver tests now cover package fields, exports conditions, wildcard
    exports, subpaths, `typesVersions`, unscoped and scoped `@types` fallback,
    and `node:*` built-in declarations via `@types/node`.
- [x] Improve overload handling.
  - [x] Prefer overloads that can be represented with concrete MoonBit types.
    - Direct local overload resolution now uses the same widening score as the
      final generated binding collapse, so broad `unknown` / `any` signatures no
      longer hide later concrete signatures.
  - [x] Emit multiple safe wrappers when overloads are materially different and
    nameable.
    - Nameable non-preferred signatures now emit stable suffixed wrappers, e.g.
      `makeCounter_number`, while preserving the original runtime export name in
      generated JS FFI glue.
  - [x] Keep a stable fallback rule when overloads collapse to `JSValue`.
    - Equal-score overloads keep declaration order and still collapse to one
      generated binding.
- [x] Expand common utility type lowering:
  - [x] `Pick` over resolvable interfaces and literal keys.
  - [x] `Omit` over resolvable interfaces and literal keys.
  - [x] `Record` as a named opaque JS object boundary.
  - [x] `Exclude` over directly comparable union members.
  - [x] `Extract` over directly comparable union members.
  - [x] `NonNullable` over optional-like unions.
  - [x] simple `ReturnType` / `Parameters` for direct function types.
  - [x] simple alias-position passthrough for resolved concrete utility aliases.
  - [x] local `typeof Class` capture for `InstanceType` /
    `ConstructorParameters` bridge lowering.
- [x] Support the common mapped-type subset needed by real declaration files.
  - [x] Lower `Partial<T>`, `Required<T>`, and `Readonly<T>` over resolvable
    interfaces into named MoonBit option-bag structs.
  - [x] Parse and lower inline mapped object types with literal keys such as
    `{ [K in "a" | "b"]: T }`.
- [x] Support the common conditional-type subset used by React, Hono, Zod, and
  Node declarations.
  - [x] Lower statically decidable `A extends B ? X : Y` when both sides are
    direct primitive / union types.
  - [x] Lower `Awaited<Promise<T>>` / `Awaited<PromiseLike<T>>`.
  - [x] Cover standard conditional utilities already represented as direct
    utility forms: `NonNullable`, `Exclude`, `Extract`, direct `ReturnType`, and
    direct `Parameters`.
  - [x] Preserve or resolve infer-based conditional aliases instead of widening
    them to `JSValue`.
    - [x] Resolve concrete infer patterns such as
      `Promise<string> extends Promise<infer T> ? T : never`.
    - [x] Preserve generic infer aliases that still depend on type parameters.
      - Generic conditional aliases are retained in the AST and resolved when
        applied to concrete type arguments, e.g. `UnwrapPromise<Promise<string>>`.
- [x] Preserve optional and readonly field information where MoonBit can express
  it; otherwise emit diagnostics instead of silent widening.
  - Optional fields are preserved as optional-like MoonBit surface types.
  - Interface `readonly` fields are retained as metadata and emitted as
    declaration / FFI diagnostics because generated MoonBit structs do not
    enforce TypeScript readonly semantics.

### Phase 3: Runtime Bridge Correctness (72% -> 78%)

- [x] Make runtime namespace handling complete for declaration-merge patterns:
  `function x` + `namespace x`, `class X` + `namespace X`, and value namespaces.
  - Declaration-merged namespace fixtures now cover root function/class/value
    exports, runtime namespace member glue, and namespace-local type references
    such as `make.Options` lowering to `MakeOptions` without leaking
    unqualified helper types.
- [x] Strengthen CJS / ESM interop:
  - `export =`
  - `export default`
  - synthetic default imports
  - namespace imports
  - mixed named/default re-exports
  - Generated fixture smokes now cover `.cjs` `export = namespace`
    runtimes through synthetic default import, `node:path` namespace imports,
    relative/parent-relative default exports, bare CJS package default
    functions, and mixed default/named class re-exports.
- [x] Add runtime smokes for async and Promise-returning APIs.
  - `Promise<T>` / `PromiseLike<T>` now lower to `@js.Promise[T]` in
    declaration and FFI generation, and a generated JS-target fixture awaits
    Promise-returning APIs with `.wait()`.
- [x] Add runtime smokes for callback APIs where the callback can be represented
  safely.
  - Callback parameters are currently represented as `JSValue` / `@js.Any`;
    the generated fixture passes required and optional JS callbacks through
    MoonBit, verifies the runtime side effect on the JS target, and covers
    MoonBit `Option` unwrapping to JS `undefined` / raw callback values.
- [x] Add runtime smokes for object option bags with optional fields.
  - Generated fixture smoke now calls a declaration-merged namespace function
    with a runtime-created `MakeOptions` object containing an optional field,
    then checks the JS target bridge through `moon check` and
    `moon test --target js`.
- [x] Add runtime smokes for class instance properties, static properties, and
  static methods.
  - Existing generated fixtures exercise instance getters/setters, mutable
    static properties, readonly static properties, and static factory methods
    across direct and re-exported class bindings.
- [x] Ensure generated `bridge.js` never imports a missing runtime binding
  without a diagnostic.
  - `unique symbol` marker exports, such as `node:assert`'s internal
    `kOptions`, are now treated as non-runtime declarations and are omitted
    from generated JS glue instead of being imported.

### Phase 4: MoonBit -> TypeScript Package Quality (78% -> 84%)

- [x] Improve method / constructor facade generation beyond the current narrow
  safe subset.
  - Facade generation now includes non-generic async constructors and instance
    methods, emits Promise-returning TypeScript declarations, and post-processes
    generated JS so plain async exports return Promises while async+raise exports
    preserve the Result wrapper expected by the declaration contract.
- [x] Define the public rule for traits:
  - Public traits are represented as declaration-only structural TypeScript
    interfaces.
  - Local `impl Trait for Type` relationships are represented in `.d.ts` output
    as `extends Trait` or type intersections where possible.
  - Trait methods are not generated as runtime bridge exports or facade
    functions; omitted runtime members remain visible through autolink
    diagnostics.
- [x] Preserve MoonBit `raise` effects in TypeScript declarations as a documented
  error contract.
  - Top-level and trait method `raise` effects now render as
    `Result<Return, ErrorType>` in generated TypeScript declarations, matching
    the JS backend's result-wrapper runtime shape.
- [x] Improve child-package and subpath export coverage:
  - [x] root exports
  - [x] nested package exports
  - [x] generated `package.json` `exports`
  - [x] matching JS and `.d.ts` paths
  - The counter scaffold fixture now includes `./child/grand`, and
    `verify-scaffolds` imports the generated nested subpath through Node while
    checking matching package metadata and `.d.ts` declarations.
- [x] Add generated source map and package metadata checks to the verification
  rail.
  - `verify-scaffolds` checks generated `package.json` package names, subpath
    exports, runtime JS files, and source map files for the scaffold fixtures.
- [x] Make facade generation deterministic and diff-friendly for review.
  - Glue declarations, `link.js.exports`, generated package `exports`, and
    child-package runtime re-export files are sorted with an explicit ascending
    string comparator instead of relying on source or map iteration order.

### Phase 5: Real-World Corpus Expansion (84% -> 88%)

- [x] Lock a TypeScript corpus that covers different API shapes:
  - small function libraries: `clsx`, `date-fns`
  - class/value libraries: `chalk`, `dotenv`
  - schema libraries: `zod`
  - web libraries: `hono`, `preact`
  - Node built-ins: `node:fs`, `node:sqlite`, `node:path`, `node:crypto`,
    `node:os`, `node:url`, `node:querystring`, `node:assert`, `node:util`,
    `node:buffer`
  - callback-heavy APIs: `node:fs`, `node:util`
  - Promise-heavy APIs: `execa`
  - CJS / export-assignment style APIs: `source-map`, Node built-ins
  - Current locked probe entries: `clsx`, `chalk`, `dotenv`, `ignore`, `hono`,
    `zod`, `date-fns`, `colorette`, `magic-string`, `source-map`, `valibot`,
    `immer`, `execa`, `preact`, `node:sqlite`, `node:fs`, `node:path`,
    `node:crypto`, `node:os`, `node:url`, `node:querystring`, `node:assert`,
    `node:util`, `node:buffer`.
- [x] Lock a MoonBit corpus that covers:
  - root-only packages
  - child-package exports
  - effectful APIs
  - generic APIs
  - private root types
  - packages with external JS bindings
  - Current checked entries: `mizchi/ast_printer`, `mizchi/js`,
    `mizchi/jsonschema`, `mizchi/markdown`, `mizchi/nom`,
    `mizchi/pixelmatch`, `mizchi/ripple`, `mizchi/semver`, `mizchi/svg`,
    `mizchi/syntree`, `mizchi/tempfile`, `mizchi/threads`, `mizchi/vfs`,
    `mizchi/jwt.mbt`, `mizchi/zlib`.
- [x] Add per-package smoke programs that use meaningful APIs, not only compile
  the generated bridge.
  - The TypeScript real-world corpus now emits package-specific MoonBit smoke
    programs and runs the built JS with Node after `moon build --target js`.
  - The MoonBit real-world corpus now includes package-specific Node smokes for
    representative APIs, including `svg`, `threads`, and `zlib`.
- [x] Keep each real-world failure as a minimized fixture before fixing it.
  - The `node:assert` missing runtime binding failure is covered by
    `unique-symbol-runtime-export-entry.d.ts`.
- [x] Track corpus status in a generated markdown report checked by CI or an
  opt-in verification task.
  - `just verify-realworld-typescript` writes
    `_build/realworld-typescript/METRICS.md`.
  - `just verify-realworld-moonbit` writes
    `_build/realworld-moonbit/REPORT.md`.

### Phase 6: Productization and Safety (88% -> 90%)

- [x] Define the public CLI contract:
  - [x] `mbt2ts --input mizchi/foo --out dist`
  - [x] `ts2mbt --input npm-package --out dist`
  - [x] `--module-spec` (`ts2mbt` only)
  - [x] `--diagnostics`
  - [x] `--strict`
  - The `tsmbt` binary was split into per-direction `ts2mbt` / `mbt2ts`
    binaries; the `--direction` flag was retired since each binary picks
    its own direction. Unified CLI help, parser tests, and README now
    document the per-binary public contract.
- [x] Add strict mode that fails on any unsupported export or unbudgeted
  `JSValue` fallback.
  - TS -> MoonBit strict mode rejects ambiguous/unsupported export surfaces
    before generation and generated `JSValue` fallback occurrences after
    generation, while writing diagnostics.
  - MoonBit -> TypeScript strict mode rejects omitted autolink members reported
    in `AUTOLINK_DIAGNOSTICS.md`.
- [x] Add non-strict mode that always emits a buildable scaffold with diagnostics
  when possible.
  - Unified TS -> MoonBit now always writes `SCAFFOLD_DIAGNOSTICS.md` or the
    requested `--diagnostics` path after scaffold generation.
  - Unified MoonBit -> TypeScript continues to write `AUTOLINK_DIAGNOSTICS.md`
    and can mirror it to `--diagnostics`.
- [x] Add snapshot tests for generated file layout and package metadata.
  - Unified MoonBit -> TypeScript and TypeScript -> MoonBit tests now assert
    generated file layouts and package metadata for the public CLI path.
- [x] Document supported TypeScript and MoonBit subsets with examples.
  - README now includes supported subset examples for both bridge directions.
- [x] Add a release checklist:
  - [x] fixture CI
  - [x] real-world TypeScript probe
  - [x] real-world MoonBit probe
  - [x] generated docs update
  - [x] changelog entry

### Explicit Non-Goals Before 90%

- [ ] Do not attempt full TypeScript type-checker parity.
- [ ] Do not implement arbitrary TypeScript conditional/mapped type semantics
  unless a real-world target needs the subset.
- [ ] Do not promise arbitrary npm package conversion without diagnostics.
- [ ] Do not hide widened or omitted API surfaces; every fallback must be
  inspectable.

## Parser / Semantics Real-World Gaps

### Current bug
- [x] `emit-moonbit-decl` / `emit-moonbit-js-ffi` should not resolve non-exported opaque type imports.
  - Symptom: an entry like `import { ResultAsync, type Result } from "neverthrow"` crashed when the package actually existed under `/tmp/.../node_modules`.
  - Cause: `load_type_module_graph` eagerly resolved every import specifier even when the imported binding was never exported or re-exported from the entry surface.
  - Fix direction: keep re-exports / exported imports in the graph, but leave plain opaque imports unresolved.

### Remaining work
- [x] Add a stable end-to-end regression harness for the external `/tmp/tsmbt-realworld-check` repro instead of relying on ad-hoc local verification.
  - Covered by the `/tmp/ts_mbt_neverthrow_like_*` regression tests in `src/main_wbtest.mbt`, which exercise `emit_moonbit_decl_text` / `emit_moonbit_js_ffi_texts` against a pnpm-style temp project layout.
- [x] Minimize a fixture from the actual `neverthrow` package if more parser coverage is needed beyond the graph-resolution fix.
  - Covered by `fixtures/resolver/project/types/neverthrow-like-entry.d.ts` plus the pnpm-style `fixtures/resolver/project/node_modules/neverthrow-like` fixture, and exercised through decl / JS FFI / scaffold generation.

## MoonBit / TypeScript Package Bridge Plan

Generate TypeScript-consumable bridge artifacts from MoonBit package interfaces without hand-writing `link.js.exports`, and keep the reverse `TS -> MoonBit` path aligned around the same surface model.

### Batch 1: MBTI autolink bootstrap

- [x] Emit `link.js.exports` JSON config from `.mbti` top-level public free functions.
- [x] Exclude methods / constructors / trait methods from the generated JS export surface.
- [x] Add CLI coverage so the generated config can be written directly from `pkg.generated.mbti`.

### Next batches

- [x] Add a recursive `.mbti` resolver so generated `.d.ts` imports can be rewritten to generated sibling packages instead of raw MoonBit package specifiers.
- [x] Add a high-level `MoonBit -> TS package scaffold` command that generates temporary autolink glue, runs `moon build --target js`, and emits a JS-backed `.d.ts` package.
- [x] Align the reverse `TS -> MoonBit bridge package` flow on the same top-level export surface model and resolver assumptions.

## Bridge / Scaffold Operational Hardening

### P0

- [x] Harden unsupported export handling in `emit-moonbit-scaffold-from-ts`.
  - Namespace exports are supported as opaque getters, and ambiguous re-exports no longer block scaffold generation; they are widened/omitted consistently with the low-level emitters and reported in `SCAFFOLD_DIAGNOSTICS.md`.
- [x] Add `just verify-scaffolds` and wire it into `just ci`.
  - Acceptance: `emit-typescript-scaffold-from-mbti` produces build-backed `index.js`, is compiled with `tsc`, and is smoke-tested through Node import; `emit-moonbit-scaffold-from-ts` is compiled/tested with `moon check/test --target js`.
- [x] Add external import rewrite mapping for `emit-typescript-scaffold-from-mbti`.
  - `emit-typescript-package-from-mbti` / `emit-typescript-scaffold-from-mbti` now accept an optional JSON rewrite map and apply it before writing external `.d.ts` imports.

### P1

- [x] Generate publish-ready metadata for `MoonBit -> TS` scaffold output.
  - `emit-typescript-scaffold-from-mbti` now writes `package.json` with `name`, `type`, `types`, `import`, and per-subpath `exports.types` entries alongside build-backed `index.js` / `.d.ts` files. Temporary `moon.pkg.json` glue is created only inside the source module and removed after `moon build --target js`.
- [x] Decide how to handle methods / static members omitted from `link.js.exports`.
  - The default scaffold still emits `AUTOLINK_DIAGNOSTICS.md` so omissions are explicit, strips runtime-inaccessible method declarations from package `.d.ts`, and `emit-typescript-facade-scaffold-from-mbti` now provides an opt-in wrapper path for root-package local non-generic methods / constructors.

### P2

- [x] Minimize a stable real-world fixture from `neverthrow` if broader package-surface coverage is still needed.
  - `just verify-scaffolds` now exercises the stable `neverthrow-like` fixture end-to-end, including generated MoonBit scaffold compile/test under JS.

### P3

- [x] Revisit broader `namespace export` support after the scaffold path is stable.
  - `emit-moonbit-scaffold-from-ts` now accepts namespace exports and exposes them as opaque getter functions in the generated package. Ambiguous re-exports are emitted conservatively and surfaced in scaffold diagnostics instead of failing fast.

## TS Bridge Constraints

- [x] Prefer direct `#module("...")` imports when the runtime `moduleSpec` is non-relative.
  - Works for bare specifiers, `node:*`, and rooted specifiers like `/src/api/client.ts`.
  - This now covers top-level function exports, instance methods/properties, and class constructors.
  - Bare package `default` function exports are intentionally routed through
    `bridge.js`; this avoids MoonBit JS backend default binding mismatches for
    CJS packages such as `express`.
- [x] Keep `bridge.js` fallback for relative module specs like `./client.js` and `../client.js`.
  - MoonBit currently rejects relative paths in `#module("...")`.
- [x] Keep wrappers for static members / value exports / namespace exports for now.
  - `= "Counter.from"` / `= "Counter.version"` style dotted import names compile poorly in the current JS backend.
  - `#module(...)` combined with inline `#|` JS also does not lower correctly for imported module bindings in the current backend.

## TS Enum / Literal Union Design

Goal: represent the safe TypeScript enum-like subset as MoonBit `enum` without
lying at the JS boundary. The generated public MoonBit API should be pleasant to
use, while the generated bridge must still pass the exact primitive values that
TypeScript runtimes expect.

### Scope

- [x] Support named string literal unions as closed MoonBit enums:
  - `type Variant = "primary" | "secondary"` ->
    `pub(all) enum Variant { Primary; Secondary }`.
  - Optional unions preserve optionality:
    `"primary" | "secondary" | undefined` -> `Variant?`.
  - Direct anonymous literal unions on exported fields / params / returns now
    receive stable synthetic names such as `ButtonOptionsVariant` and
    `RenderButtonReturn`.
- [x] Support boolean literal unions only when they are not just `boolean`:
  - `true | false` remains `Bool`.
  - `true | undefined` remains `Bool?`.
  - Named boolean literal aliases now resolve through primitive `Bool` /
    `Bool?` bridge signatures instead of emitting enum wrappers.
- [x] Support numeric literal unions only when every member is an integer-like
  literal and the runtime bridge can convert losslessly.
  - [x] Named numeric literal union aliases lower to closed MoonBit enums and
    bridge through raw `Int` params / returns.
  - [x] Direct anonymous numeric literal unions use the same synthetic naming
    pass and bridge through raw `Int` params / returns.
- [x] Support ambient / declaration enum surfaces:
  - `declare enum Mode { Read = "read" }`
  - `declare const enum Mode { Read = "read" }`
  - implicit numeric members are allowed only when all previous values can be
    evaluated statically.
  - [x] Parser preserves `declare enum` / `declare const enum` in `TsModule`,
    including declared namespaces, and bridge package output now exposes those
    enums in both `bridge.mbt` and `bridge.mbti`.
  - [x] Raw extern wrappers keep string enums primitive and expose public
    MoonBit enum wrappers for params and returns.
  - [x] Optional string enum params / returns use `Variant?` conversion and
    keep JS `undefined` behavior.
  - [x] Raw extern wrappers keep statically evaluable numeric enums as `Int`
    and expose public MoonBit enum wrappers for params and returns, including
    optional `Variant?` conversion.
- [x] Defer heterogeneous enum unions and non-literal computed enum values to
  the existing primitive / `JSValue` fallback with diagnostics.

### Internal Model

- [x] Replace or extend the current `TsType::Literal(String)` representation.
  - Current parser stores string `"1"` and numeric `1` both as `Literal("1")`,
    which is not precise enough for bridge conversion.
  - Add a typed literal model, e.g. `TsLiteralValue::{String, Number, BigInt,
    Bool}`, and keep helper functions so existing `keyof` / object-key logic
    can continue treating string keys uniformly.
  - `TsType` now keeps string literal/object keys as `Literal(String)` while
    preserving non-string literal types as `NumberLiteral`, `BigIntLiteral`,
    and `BooleanLiteral`.
- [x] Add AST nodes for enum declarations:
  - `TsEnumDecl { name, members, is_const, is_declare }`
  - `TsEnumMember { name, value : TsLiteralValue? }`
  - Store them in `TsModule` and `TsModuleBlock`, parallel to interfaces and
    type aliases.
  - [x] Added `TsEnumDecl`, `TsEnumMember`, and `TsEnumMemberValue` to
    `TsModule`; module-block export collection now recognizes
    `export declare enum` for bridge export surfaces.
  - [x] `TsEnumMember.is_computed` now distinguishes implicit numeric enum
    members from non-literal computed initializers.
  - [x] `TsModuleBlock` still needs a first-class enum array if script-level
    enum declarations need to be preserved beyond export metadata.
- [x] Normalize type aliases that are pure string literal unions into an enum-lowering
  candidate before `emit_moonbit_decl` / `emit_moonbit_js_ffi` renders types.
  - Keep the original alias name as the MoonBit enum name.
  - If the alias is anonymous inside a parameter or field, keep the current
    primitive fallback until a stable synthetic naming rule is needed.

### MoonBit Surface

- [x] Emit public enum declarations in both `bridge.mbt` and `bridge.mbti`.
  - This must mirror the recent struct rule: generated implementation and
    interface files expose the same public shape.
  - [x] Ambient enum exports are emitted as `pub(all) enum` in both package
    implementation and interface output.
  - [x] Runtime TypeScript `export enum` declarations are preserved through
    `TsModuleBlock` export discovery and emitted in package bridge output.
- [x] Generate stable constructor names:
  - sanitize to PascalCase;
  - suffix MoonBit keywords;
  - disambiguate collisions deterministically;
  - preserve the original TS literal in generated conversion helpers.
- [x] Keep raw externs primitive and wrap them for string enums:
  - Params: public function accepts `Variant`, private/raw extern accepts
    `String`.
  - Returns: raw extern returns primitive, public wrapper converts to
    `Variant`.
  - Optional params / returns use `Variant?` wrappers and keep JS `undefined`
    behavior through generated optional conversion helpers.

Example target shape:

```moonbit
pub(all) enum ButtonVariant {
  Primary
  Secondary
} derive(Eq, Debug)

fn ButtonVariant::to_js(self : ButtonVariant) -> String {
  match self {
    Primary => "primary"
    Secondary => "secondary"
  }
}

fn button_variant_from_js(value : String) -> ButtonVariant {
  match value {
    "primary" => Primary
    "secondary" => Secondary
    _ => abort("unexpected ButtonVariant value")
  }
}

extern "js" fn render_button_raw(variant : String) -> Unit = "__ts_mbt_render_button"

pub fn renderButton(variant : ButtonVariant) -> Unit {
  render_button_raw(variant.to_js())
}
```

### JS Bridge Rules

- [x] Do not pass MoonBit enum runtime objects directly to JS APIs for string
  enums.
  - MoonBit JS backend enums are tagged values; TypeScript libraries expect the
    primitive literal value.
- [x] Prefer MoonBit-side conversion wrappers over JS-side enum construction.
  - JS bridge code cannot reliably construct MoonBit enum values unless those
    constructors are exported by the compiled MoonBit package.
  - Return conversion should therefore happen in generated MoonBit wrapper
    code from raw primitive externs.
- [x] Reuse the existing optional object-field converter only after enum values
  have been converted to primitives.

### Diagnostics and Safety

- [x] Add diagnostics for every enum-like surface that is not lowered:
  - [x] mixed string/number enum;
  - [x] computed enum member;
  - [x] duplicate literal values after sanitization;
  - [x] mixed / non-integer / bigint named literal-union aliases;
  - [x] anonymous literal union without a stable public name.
- [x] Keep strict mode behavior unchanged: unsupported enum lowering in a
  public surface must either fall back within budget or fail with an actionable
  diagnostic.
- [x] Add real-world probes after fixtures pass:
  - [x] Node string modes / flags;
  - [x] React string literal props;
  - [x] Hono option modes;
  - [x] TypeScript AST `SyntaxKind`-style numeric enum as an `Int` bridge
    stress case.

### TDD Order

- [x] Red: parser tests for string/numeric/const enum declarations and typed
  literal unions.
- [x] Green: AST + parser support without bridge lowering.
- [x] Red: declaration generation tests for named literal-union aliases.
- [x] Green: emit MoonBit enum declarations in `.mbt` / `.mbti`.
- [x] Red: JS-target smoke where a MoonBit enum argument reaches a TS function
  expecting a string literal.
  - `fixtures/bridge_smoke/enum-entry.d.ts` verifies generated code passes
    primitive string enum values through `moon check --target js` and
    `moon test --target js`.
- [x] Green: raw extern + public wrapper conversion for params.
- [x] Red: JS-target smoke where a TS function returns a literal union and
  MoonBit pattern matches the result.
  - Named string literal union aliases are covered by
    `fixtures/bridge_smoke/literal-union-alias-entry.d.ts`.
- [x] Green: primitive return conversion with an explicit unexpected-value
  abort path.
- [x] Refactor: share enum metadata between decl, FFI, and package bridge
  emitters so literal-union and `declare enum` use the same lowering path.
  - [x] Share ambient enum case/value/unsupported-reason lowering between
    declaration diagnostics and FFI generation.
  - [x] Share literal-union alias enum declaration lowering through
    `enum_lowering_type_alias_enum_decl`.

## Normalized DTS Shape-Merge Scope

- [x] Keep object-shape compatibility checks inside `src/bridge/object_shape_merge.mbt`.
  - The helper exists to support `normalize-moonbit-dts`, not to become a full TypeScript checker.
- [x] Keep the shape-merge scope narrow.
  - Current responsibility: decide whether object-like interface expansions can be flattened safely, or should fall back to intersections.
  - Current coverage: duplicate properties, `readonly`, optional-property keys, and "do not merge methods / overload-like members".
- [x] Avoid growing the bridge normalization helper into a full semantic checker unless a separate goal is explicitly chosen.
  - If future work needs real TS semantics, define that as a separate milestone instead of quietly expanding the normalization helper.

## Bridge Const-Table Batch Plan

Reduce the need to pick one edge case at a time by shipping the next `default export const table` batch together and keeping the smoke rail in sync.

### Batch scope

- [x] `import * as tables from "./x"` where `x` exports a const table.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` re-exports a named `const TABLES`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` directly `export default { ... }`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default { ... } as const`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default (() => ({ ... }))()`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default (() => { const ...; return TABLES })()`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default (function() { const ...; return TABLES })()`.

### Acceptance rail

- [x] Add parser regression proving exported const-value collection for each new default-export shape.
- [x] Add decl / JS FFI / bridge-package regressions for each new shape.
- [x] Add bridge smoke fixtures so `just verify-generated-fixtures` and `just ci` execute the generated package under JS.

### Next batch: IIFE local let handling

- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default (() => { let ...; return TABLES })()`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default (function() { let ...; return TABLES })()`.
- [x] Keep local `let` mutation conservative: if the returned table depends on reassigned locals, widen instead of resolving statically.
- [x] Add parser / decl / JS FFI / bridge-package regressions for the `let` cases.
- [x] Add bridge smoke fixtures for positive `let` cases and the conservative widened case.

### Next batch: IIFE local mutation conservative handling

- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` mutates `KEYS.nested` before returning the table.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` mutates `INDEXES[0]` before returning the table.
- [x] Keep local property/index mutation conservative even when the final runtime value is unchanged.
- [x] Add parser / decl / JS FFI / bridge-package regressions for the mutation cases.
- [x] Add bridge smoke fixtures for the conservative widened mutation cases.

## React / JSX Real-World Support

Keep pushing real package support through `.d.ts` surface parsing and scaffold generation before adding a full JSX expression parser.

### Current status

- [x] Accept `export as namespace ...` without crashing `emit-moonbit-scaffold-from-ts`.
- [x] Flatten `export = React; declare namespace React { ... }` style surfaces into top-level scaffold exports.
- [x] Surface nested `JSX` namespace types from `react`, `react/jsx-runtime`, and `react/jsx-dev-runtime`.
- [x] Normalize the first round of React utility types:
  - `PropsWithChildren<T>`
  - `ComponentProps<"tag">`
  - `ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"tag">`
  - `ComponentPropsWithRef<"tag">`
  - nested `PropsWithChildren<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<...>>`
- [x] Convert known React hook tuple returns into named synthetic result types.
- [x] Preserve optional React-style props/params as `T?` instead of widening everything to `JSValue`.
- [x] Make generated MoonBit identifiers safe for reserved words and dotted ambient names.

### Next work

- [x] Reduce widening around React overload-heavy APIs.
  - Priority targets: `createElement`, `cloneElement`, `forwardRef`, `memo`.
  - [x] Lower `keyof JSX.IntrinsicElements` parameters to `String` for `createElement` / JSX runtime entrypoints instead of `JSValue`.
- [x] Model exotic/callable component surfaces more explicitly.
  - Priority targets: `FunctionComponent`, `ForwardRefExoticComponent`, `MemoExoticComponent`, `NamedExoticComponent`.
  - Callable React component surfaces are emitted as opaque external JS callable types in FFI output instead of fake record structs with `<call>` fields.
- [x] Improve utility/conditional type lowering beyond the first pass.
  - Priority targets: `ReactNode`, `ComponentRef`, `ElementRef`, `LibraryManagedAttributes`, `RefAttributes`.
  - `Partial<T>` / `Readonly<T>` pass through to `T`; `LibraryManagedAttributes<C, P>` lowers to `P`; `ComponentRef<T>` / `ElementRef<T>` lower to `Ref`; `ReactNode` lowers to `JSValue` / `@js.Any` at the generated bridge boundary.
- [x] Add stable end-to-end verification for generated React scaffolds under `moon check/test --target js`.
  - `just verify-scaffolds` now checks React-like JSX, `react/jsx-runtime`, `react/jsx-dev-runtime`, and the Hono options fixture with generated packages under the JS target. The React cases use a local `mizchi/js/core` stub instead of depending on a separate checkout.
- [x] Add stable fixture coverage for `react`, `react/jsx-runtime`, `react/jsx-dev-runtime`, and `hono/jsx`.
  - Keep real-world probe findings as minimized fixtures instead of ad-hoc `/tmp` checks.
  - Minimized package fixtures live under `fixtures/resolver/project/node_modules/react` and `fixtures/resolver/project/node_modules/hono`; `just verify-scaffolds` now compiles/tests generated MoonBit packages against those package names.
- [x] Keep JSX parser work deferred until `.d.ts` type-surface parsing is no longer the blocker.
  - Re-evaluate only if React/Hono support hits syntax that cannot be represented from declaration files alone.

## Real-World MoonBit Package Probe

- [x] Support `tsmbt --input mizchi/foo --out dist/` style ghq package resolution for MoonBit packages.
- [x] Verify build-backed `MoonBit -> TypeScript` scaffold generation through `moon build --target js` for local `mizchi/ripple`, `mizchi/semver`, and `mizchi/tempfile` checkouts.
  - `just verify-realworld-moonbit` is optional and skipped package-by-package when those local ghq checkouts are absent.
- [x] Broaden the local real-world probe set to `mizchi/ast_printer`, `mizchi/js`, `mizchi/jsonschema`, `mizchi/markdown`, `mizchi/nom`, `mizchi/pixelmatch`, `mizchi/syntree`, `mizchi/tui`, `mizchi/vfs`, and `mizchi/jwt.mbt`.
- [x] Resolve ghq packages whose repository name differs from their MoonBit module name by reading `moon.mod.json` metadata.
- [x] Preserve MoonBit `raise` effects in temporary glue wrappers so effectful packages such as `mizchi/semver` build.
- [x] Skip facade wrappers that would expose private root types from the source package; the generated `.d.ts` can still document those opaque types, but glue packages cannot refer to private MoonBit symbols.
- [x] Qualify local root trait bounds in temporary glue wrappers so generic packages such as `mizchi/nom` build.
- [x] Emit child-package runtime re-export files and facade declarations so recursive MoonBit -> TypeScript packages expose matching `.d.ts` and JS subpaths.
- [x] Add stable real-world MBTI declaration snapshots for `mizchi/ast_printer` and `mizchi/jsonschema` to default fixture typechecking.
- [x] Re-run the local real-world MoonBit probe and confirm the current package set passes generated JS import and declaration typecheck.
- [x] Investigate packages that fail before or during source JS build for reasons outside the generated glue surface.
  - `mizchi/ast_printer` was fixed by updating its `moonbitlang/parser` dependency from `0.1.15` to `0.2.5` and adapting the printer to the current parser AST (`type P = Point` aliases, no removed top-level alias constructors, `TypeDesc::Record(fields~, ..)`).

## CI Notes

- Default `just ci` remains fixture-based and does not require local ghq checkouts.
- `just verify-realworld-moonbit` is intentionally outside default CI because it probes developer-local MoonBit repositories and writes temporary glue packages into those source modules during `moon build --target js`.
- `just verify-realworld-typescript` is intentionally outside default CI because it probes a developer-local npm package corpus via `TSMBT_REALWORLD_TYPESCRIPT_NODE_MODULES`.

## Beyond 90%: Bridge Quality Gaps for Tier 2 / Tier 3 Packages (2026-05-03)

After the 90% gate, the remaining `naturalize-target` and `budgeted-fallback`
JSValue surfaces are dominated by a small set of structural limitations rather
than ad-hoc fixes. The previous demand-driven plateau was reached at hono = 50,
date-fns = 22, jose = 84, react-router = 194, etc., where each remaining
fallback traces to one of the items below. Each item is a multi-commit
structural change, not a one-off lowering tweak.

Priority is by impact on real-world bridge JSValue surface, not by ease.

### 1. Heterogeneous union -> auto-enum (highest ROI, bridge-local)

Patterns: `number | string | Date` (jose setters), `(string | number)[]` (immer
Patch.path), `string | string[]`, `boolean | "boundary"` (magic-string hires),
`boolean | OverwriteOptions` (magic-string), schema-leaf branches in zod /
valibot.

- [x] Detect heterogeneous unions whose members can each be discriminated at
  runtime (`typeof` for primitives, `instanceof` for known classes, optional
  fallback for plain objects).
- [x] Lower the alias / synthetic-named union into a `pub(all) enum` with one
  case per member, where each case wraps the lowered MoonBit type (e.g.
  `Number(Double) | StringValue(String) | DateValue(Date)`).
- [x] Generate paired conversion helpers: MoonBit-side `to_js(self) -> JSValue`
  using primitive coercions, and JS-side discrimination wrappers in
  `bridge.js`.
- [x] Reuse the existing literal-union synthetic naming pass for anonymous
  heterogeneous unions on params / fields / return types.
  - Mixed primitive + string/number/bigint/boolean literal unions now lower
    too: literal cases become no-payload enum constructors (e.g. `Boundary`)
    discriminated via `=== "boundary"`. Pure literal unions still defer to
    `enum_lowering`, and a literal whose primitive type collides with a
    non-literal sibling stays on JSValue.
- [x] Auto-wrap return values to the MoonBit-side `<alias>_from_js`
  representation when the discriminator is purely typeof / isArray / strict
  equality. Tagged-union aliases that depend on `instanceof <NamedClass>`
  (e.g. `ServerType = Server | Http2Server | Http2SecureServer` from
  `node:net` / `node:http2`) are skipped because the named classes aren't
  reachable from `bridge.js`.
- [x] Emit diagnostics and stay on JSValue when discrimination is ambiguous
  (e.g. two struct members with overlapping shapes).
  - `tagged_union_widen_reason_for_alias` reports the rejection cause
    (overlapping primitive discriminator, non-PascalCase / non-discriminable
    member, or duplicate constructor name) and the resolution chain in
    `moonbit_decl.mbt` surfaces it as a `Unsupported export <Name>: ...`
    comment in the generated `bridge.mbti`. Pure-literal unions still
    defer silently to `enum_lowering`, and `null` / `undefined` markers
    are filtered out before evaluating discrimination so plain optional
    widening doesn't get diagnosed.
- [x] Add real-world budgets: jose, magic-string, immer, and zod / valibot
  schema leaves where applicable.
  - `just verify-realworld-typescript` is back to a green baseline across
    all 24 corpus entries; per-package `JSValue` cause budgets, function
    counts, and unsupported-export budgets now reflect the actual
    generated output, including the new heterogeneous-union diagnostics.

### 2. Method-level generics preserved through bridge

Patterns: `Hono<E,S,P>.get<Path extends string>(path: Path, handler):
Hono<E, S, P | Path>`, `Session.get<Key extends keyof Data>(key: Key)`,
`zod.object<T extends ZodRawShape>(shape: T)`.

- [x] Capture method-level type parameter lists (and bounds) on
  `TsClassMethodDecl`. (commit `eeb94a6`)
- Investigation result (2026-05-03): bound substitution at method
  boundaries is **already happening** in `parser_type.mbt:639`
  (`local_type_param_bound`), which short-circuits any `Ident(name)`
  to its registered bound during type parsing. Methods like
  `HonoRequest.valid<T extends keyof ValidationTargets>(target: T)`
  already render as `valid(target : String) -> ...` because `T` is
  substituted away before the AST escapes the parser.
- MoonBit JS backend rejects `pub extern "js" fn[T] ...`
  (`Error 4008: FFI function cannot have type parameters`), so a
  generic-preserving public signature would require a separate
  wrapper layer (`pub fn[T] Class::method(...) { Class::method_raw(...) }`).
  This only buys typing precision when the bound is itself
  representable as a MoonBit trait, which is rare for the
  string-literal / interface bounds used in real corpora.
- [x] Conclusion: keep the AST fields populated so a later
  wrapper-layer pass can use them, but do not generate a separate
  generic surface yet. The bound-substitute path covers the common
  cases. Revisit only when a real-world consumer needs a generic
  return type that is not represented by the substituted bound.

### 3. Mapped type partial evaluation + conditional reduction depth

Patterns: zod `output<T>` / `infer<T>` mapped types, valibot equivalent,
date-fns `EachDayOfIntervalResult<I, O>` (Array<conditional + infer + indexed
access>), jose key-typed builders.

- [x] Extend `simplify_type` so distributive conditional types reduce when each
  branch resolves to the same concrete shape after bound substitution and
  infer extraction. (Done via the `Union` source path in `simplify_type` —
  every leaf must resolve definitively; otherwise the conditional is
  preserved for a later retry.)
- [~] Branch-join over `Array<Conditional<...>>`: the simplifier reduces a
  union of conditionals when every branch decides, but doesn't yet
  collect leaf branches and accept the join when only the terminal-default
  shape matches. Low real-world ROI; left for later.
- [x] Lower mapped types with key remapping (`{ [K in keyof T as ...]: ... }`)
  for the common output-shape pattern used by zod / valibot. (Implemented
  via `MappedTypeRemap` + `simplify_mapped_type_remap`.)
- [x] Treat unresolvable infer patterns as their bound rather than `JSValue` so
  generic `infer DateType extends Date` collapses to `Date` at the bridge
  boundary. (`moonbit_decl.mbt` / `moonbit_js_ffi.mbt` consult
  `infer_marker_bound` at the surface boundary;
  `match_infer_pattern` now also rejects sources definitively disjoint
  from the bound at match time.)

### 4. Template literal types

Patterns: node:util `InspectColorBackground = bg${Capitalize<InspectColorForeground>}`,
react-router path patterns, zod template-literal validators.

- [x] Add AST nodes for template literal types (`TsType::TemplateLiteralType`)
  including `Capitalize` / `Lowercase` / `Uppercase` / `Uncapitalize` intrinsic
  string-mapping types.
- [x] Resolve template literal types to a string-literal union when the
  parameter is a finite string-literal union. (`simplify_template_literal`
  cartesian-products the part / arg pairs.)
- [x] Reuse the existing string-literal-union enum-lowering path for template
  literal types whose parameter union is small and safely PascalCase-able.
  (Bridge enum lowering walks the template result.)
- [x] Otherwise fall back to `String` rather than `JSValue` when the template
  shape is statically known to produce strings.
  (`TemplateLiteralType(_, _) => "String"` in both decl / FFI renderers.)

### 5. JSX / component layer

Patterns: preact / react-router component definitions, `FunctionComponent<P>`,
`ForwardRefExoticComponent`, JSX intrinsic elements.

- [~] Open design decision: a JSX-aware bridge layer ships as MoonBit-native
  types in the existing bridge. No separate generator output is planned.
- [x] Preserve `FunctionComponent<P>` as a callable opaque whose props are
  represented as the resolved `P` struct. (Done via the React-specific
  utility lowering pass; callable component surfaces are emitted as opaque
  external JS callable types.)
- [~] Lower `JSX.Element` to a JS-opaque type that round-trips through bridge
  glue without widening to `JSValue` for every render call. Current state
  collapses `JSX.Element` to `@js.Any` at the bridge boundary; a dedicated
  opaque type per JSX namespace is still open.
- [~] Re-evaluate preact / react-router naturalize budgets after JSX layer.
  Budgets updated as needed when the bridge realigns; no fresh pass is
  scheduled.

### 6. Class static-side / index signature / module augmentation

Patterns: jose builder pattern (`new SignJWT(payload).setIssuedAt()...`),
magic-string `MagicString` static helpers, hono `c.set()` per-context
augmentation, React `HTMLAttributes` index signatures.

- [x] Class static-side (`typeof Class`) merging: `PropAccess` on a class
  identifier consults `globals[Name.member]` (which catches namespace + class
  declaration merging) and the class's static methods / properties before
  falling back to instance-side lookup.
- [x] Lower `[key: string]: V` index signatures: `TsClassDecl.index_signatures`
  carries the parsed entries and `lookup_class_field` falls through to
  `index_signature_value` after exhausting named members. The
  `TsInterface` side already worked.
- [x] Module augmentation graph: `TsModule.module_augmentations :
  Array[(String, TsModule)]` records every `declare module "X" { ... }`
  block by specifier; declarations still flow into the surrounding scope
  for legacy consumers.

### 7. Modern syntax follow-ups (smaller)

- [x] `satisfies` operator at the expression level. (Parser retains
  `Satisfies(expr, ty)`; checker validates assignment in
  `check_call_args_in_expr`.)
- [x] Stage-3 decorators on classes. (`TsClassDecl.decorators` retains the
  parsed `@expr` chain.)
- [x] `using` / `await using` declarations including `export using` at the
  module export position.
- [x] Const generics (`<const T>`). Retained on `TsFunc.const_type_params`
  and consulted by the JSX generic-component inference path to skip
  literal widening when any of the component's type parameters carries
  the modifier.

### Non-Goals (still)

- [ ] Do not turn this list into a checklist for "all of TypeScript". Each item
  must justify itself by removing real-world JSValue surface from the locked
  corpus.
- [ ] Do not pursue `any` / `unknown` AST distinction unless a downstream
  consumer needs it; the JSValue count is unaffected.

## TypeScript Compatibility Inventory (2026-05-23)

Snapshot of remaining TypeScript-language compatibility surface, taken after
the JSX round-up (PR #15) and the fmt normalization (PR #17). Conformance
corpus baseline: `total=1936 parsed=1841 checked=1841` (checker crashes 0).

Legend: `[x]` covered, `[~]` parsed but lossy / dropped to `Any`, `[ ]` not
started.

### Syntax (parser)

- [x] `asserts x is T` predicate — retained as `AssertsPredicate(name,
  target?)`; lowers to `Unit` at the bridge boundary; statement-level
  narrowing applied at the call site.
- [x] `new (...) => T` / `abstract new (...) => T` constructor types —
  retained as `Constructor(params, ret, is_abstract)` and feed
  `ConstructorParameters<C>` / `InstanceType<C>` through the standard
  utility table.
- [x] Stage-3 decorators — `TsClassDecl.decorators` carries the parsed
  `@expr` chain in source order via the new `parse_decorator_expr`
  helper that produces a faithful `TsExpr` (call, member access, etc.).
- [x] `<const T>` const type parameter — retained as
  `TsFunc.const_type_params : Array[Bool]` (positionally aligned with
  `type_params`). The checker's JSX generic-component inference path
  consults the matching `Resolver.func_const_type_params` entry and
  skips the literal-widening pass for the matching binding, so
  `<Comp value="hello" />` against `function Comp<const T>(props :
  Props<T>)` infers `T = "hello"` instead of `T = string`.
- [x] Import attributes (`import x from "y" with { type: "json" }`) —
  retained as `TsImportDecl.attributes : Array[(String, String)]` via
  the new `parse_import_attributes` helper; the legacy `assert { ... }`
  form lands in the same slot.
- [x] Labeled tuple `[name: T, age: U]` — labels stripped; `[name?: T]`
  correctly widens the element to `T | undefined`.
- [x] Variadic tuple types (`[string, ...T, number]`) — parsed and
  retained as `Tuple([..., Rest(T), ...])`; outside a tuple position
  `Rest(T)` lowers like `Array(T)`.
- [x] Mapped-type key remapping (`{ [K in U as F<K>]: V }`) — parsed
  as `MappedTypeRemap(...)`; simplifier substitutes `K` per key and
  produces an `Object(...)` when the source / remap resolve, dropping
  keys whose remap evaluates to `Never`.
- [x] `accessor` field (auto-accessor) —
  `TsClassPropertyDecl.is_accessor` flags the property; structurally
  identical to a regular property + synthesised getter/setter.
- [~] `using` / `await using` runtime semantics (parser already accepts
  the binding form; disposable-tracking is intentionally out of scope —
  it has no effect on bridge generation).
- [x] Dynamic `import(spec, options)`: `DynamicImport` carries the
  optional second argument so the attribute payload survives. Bare
  one-arg form keeps the `None` slot.
- [x] Inline per-specifier `import { type X, Y }` modifier —
  `TsImportDecl.named_type_only : Array[Bool]` is positionally aligned
  with `named_bindings`; `true` indicates the `type` prefix was used.
- [x] JSX explicit generic type arguments `<Box<string> ... />` — the
  JSX header scanner skips the balanced angle brackets after the tag
  name before attribute parsing.

### Type system (checker)

- [x] Union / Intersection / Conditional + distributive / Generics / infer.
- [x] Utility table: `Pick / Omit / Record / Exclude / Extract / NonNullable /
  ReturnType / Parameters / Awaited`.
- [x] String-mapping intrinsics (`Capitalize / Lowercase / Uppercase /
  Uncapitalize`) in `simplify.mbt`.
- [x] `InstanceType<C>` / `ConstructorParameters<C>` — first-class
  utility-table entries that reduce through
  `is_assignable_to_with_generics` and pattern-match on the new
  `Constructor(...)` shape.
- [x] `ThisParameterType<F>` / `OmitThisParameter<F>` / `ThisType<T>`
  — all three are standard utility-table entries; `ThisType<T>` is
  the identity because we don't model contextual-`this` inference.
- [x] `NoInfer<T>` (TS 5.4+) — identity alias in the utility table.
- [x] Mapped-type key remapping (`as`) evaluation in `simplify_type`
  including `Capitalize<K>` / template-literal prefixing and
  `K extends X ? never : K` filter patterns.
- [x] Mapped-type modifier semantics: leading `readonly` / `+readonly`
  / `-readonly` consumed, trailing `?` / `+?` widen with `Undefined`,
  trailing `-?` strips `Undefined` from the value type after
  substitution via a synthetic `__tsmbt_strip_undef` marker.
- [x] Conditional `infer T extends Bound` constraint at match time:
  `match_infer_pattern` rejects sources that are definitively disjoint
  from the bound; surface renderers already collapse unresolved
  infer-with-bound markers to the bound.
- [x] Variadic tuple inference: `Resolver::ingest_module` wraps a
  function's rest parameter as `Rest(T)` so `Parameters<typeof f>`
  binds `P` to the rest-tail tuple.
- [x] Non-distributive conditional detection (`[T] extends [U] ? X :
  Y`) — both-side length-1 tuple shape is detected by `simplify_type`
  and reduced by unwrapping before `extends_decision`.
- [x] `unique symbol` distinct identity: `UniqueSymbol(tag)` carries
  a per-occurrence tag assigned by the parser; `extends_decision`
  reports `Some(false)` for distinct tags and widens to plain
  `Symbol`. Bridge surface still lowers to `Symbol` / `JSValue`, and
  the existing non-runtime-binding filter treats both variants
  uniformly.
- [x] Class static-side (`typeof Cls`) vs instance-side separation —
  `typeof_class_constructor_params_type` /
  `typeof_class_instance_type` cover the
  `ConstructorParameters<typeof Cls>` / `InstanceType<typeof Cls>`
  cases at the bridge layer, and `PropAccess` on a class identifier
  now consults the namespace-merged `globals` map plus the class's
  static members before falling back to the instance-side lookup.
- [x] Class index signature `[k: string]: V` — `TsClassDecl` carries
  the parsed signatures and `lookup_class_field` falls through to
  `index_signature_value` after exhausting named members.
- [x] Module augmentation graph — `TsModule.module_augmentations :
  Array[(String, TsModule)]` records every top-level `declare module
  "X" { ... }` block by specifier. The contained declarations also
  flow into the surrounding scope for legacy consumers; downstream
  tooling that wants the per-module view can read the new field
  directly.
- [x] Declaration merging (interface + interface) — `Resolver::ingest_module`
  now unions fields / readonly / extends / index signatures via
  `merge_interfaces`. Namespace + namespace was already implicit via
  the recursive ingest, and namespace + class static-side merging
  works through the `PropAccess` lookup extension.
- [x] Tagged-template literal typing — `tag\`...\`` returns the
  declared return type of `tag` when known instead of always collapsing
  to `String`. Real generic inference across template segments is still
  deferred (rare in our corpus).
- [x] Generator / async-iterator yield-type checking — `CheckCtx`
  carries the declared element type and `yield e` / `yield* iter` are
  validated against it; the missing-return diagnostic is suppressed
  for generator bodies.
- [x] `in` narrowing for record-shaped operands +
  switch-discriminator exhaustiveness — `In` narrowing already handled
  records, and `apply_switch_disc_default_narrowing` now strips every
  tag-matched union member from the discriminator in the `default:`
  body so the remainder is `Never` when the cases exhaust the union.

### JSX

- [x] Component prop checking, spread attrs, `key` / `ref` reserved.
- [x] Render props, recursive child checking.
- [x] `.map(...)` child key warning.
- [x] Member-expression tags `<Foo.Bar />`.
- [x] Generic component explicit type args `<Box<string> ... />`.
- [ ] `defaultProps` reflection in required-prop checking — deferred
  (React 19 deprecates `defaultProps`; default parameter values on the
  component function already cover the modern pattern).
- [~] Fragment (`<></>`) key on the iterating side — `key` on a JSX
  fragment is only meaningful for React.Fragment; the bare `<></>`
  form has no attribute slot, so the `.map`-key warning already skips
  fragments (`tag == ""`).
- [ ] `JSX.LibraryManagedAttributes` reflection — deferred (TS-only
  shim for class-component `defaultProps`; not used outside React 18-).

### Module resolver / surrounding

- [x] `exports` / `typesVersions` / `node:*` / `@types/*` resolution.
- [ ] Yarn PnP (`.pnp.cjs`) resolution — deferred (pnpm is the corpus
  default; PnP doesn't appear).
- [~] Import-attribute driven type-only routing (e.g. JSON modules) —
  attributes are read and discarded; JSON modules already resolve via
  the file-based path.
- [x] `tsconfig.json` `paths` mapping — handled by
  `resolve_tsconfig_specifier` (paths + baseUrl + wildcard targets).

### Conformance corpus follow-up

- [x] Triage the remaining parse failures — current parse rate is
  1843/1936 (95.2 %). The remaining ~93 failures fall into:
  - `*Errors.ts` / `*invalid*.ts` / `*NoCrash*.ts` fixtures the TS
    team uses to verify their own error recovery — those produce
    parser-level errors here too, which matches expected behaviour.
  - `using` declarations in invalid positions (`declare using`,
    `for (await using of …)` PR-specific edge cases). Our parser
    accepts the canonical forms; the invalid ones stay as errors.
  - Class member overload signatures with mismatched access
    modifiers (`public … protected … constructor`). Edge-case
    grammar, one fixture each.
- [x] Measure issue-count precision (not just crash rate) on the
  corpus so checker regressions surface before they reach real-world
  generation.
  - `scripts/checker_precision.sh` sweeps available TypeScript files
    (TypeScript compiler source when submodule is populated, bench +
    fixture files always), records issue counts per file as JSON.
  - `scripts/checker_precision_compare.py` diffs two JSON baselines
    and exits 1 on any regression (issue-count increase on a
    previously-clean file).
  - Usage: `scripts/checker_precision.sh --out _build/checker_baseline.json`
    to capture; `scripts/checker_precision.sh --compare _build/checker_baseline.json`
    to detect regressions in CI.

  deprecates the underlying pattern; modern components use default
  parameter values which we already cover.

## Conformance Recall / Precision Push (2026-06-01)

Baseline accuracy gate is now live at
`src/parser/parser_typescript_wbtest.mbt:checker: accuracy against
TypeScript conformance baselines`. Measurements against 822
conformance sources (`.errors.txt` baseline = ground truth):

```
                   recall              precision (clean cases)
2026-06-01 (T0)    143/487 (29 %)      243/319 (76 %, 76 FP)
2026-06-01 (T1)    144/487 (30 %)      243/319 (76 %, 76 FP)
2026-06-01 (T2)    212/487 (44 %)      217/319 (68 %, 102 FP)
2026-06-01 (T3)    207/487 (42 %)      232/319 (73 %, 87 FP)
2026-06-01 (T4)    205/487 (42 %)      241/319 (76 %, 78 FP)
2026-06-01 (T5)    207/487 (43 %)      241/319 (76 %, 78 FP)
```

- T0: starting point.
- T1: + duplicate parameter / type-parameter lints, + bare-`T`
  property-access silencing (commit `99fed36`).
- T2: + parser preserves top-level expression statements so calls
  and `t = a;` style assignments are checked against declared types.
  Recall jumped +47 %; precision dropped 8 pt because untyped DOM /
  Node globals at module scope now produce more "method does not
  exist" / argument-count diagnostics.
- T3: + non-strict null assignability (a *literal* `null` / `undefined`
  source is assignable to any target, matching `@strict: false`) and
  + string-literal bracket access on primitives (`x["charAt"](0)`,
  `n["toExponential"]()`) no longer flag "cannot index into" /
  "is not callable". FP −15 (102 → 87). Recall −5: the only regressions
  are the strict-mode null tests (`undefinedAssignableToEveryType`,
  `validNullAssignments`) where null/undefined assignment *is* the
  baseline error — an accepted strict-vs-non-strict trade-off given we
  have no per-file strict signal. Net +10 correct verdicts.
- T4: + three more precision fixes (FP 87 -> 78, recall −2):
  - `never` target accepts any source (the `assertNever(x: never)`
    exhaustiveness idiom flow-narrows `x` to `never`, which we can't
    model). Cleared numericLiteralTypes{1,2}, enumLiteralTypes{1,2},
    stringEnumLiteralTypes{1,2}.
  - `true | false` (a union covering both boolean literals) accepts
    `boolean` as a source — they are the same type. Cleared the
    booleanLiteralTypes{1,2} `expected true | false but got boolean`.
  - Optional arity recovered from parameter *types* (`x?: T` widens to
    `T | undefined`) when no rich `TsParam` sig is available, so calling
    a function-typed variable / method / call-signature with a trailing
    optional omitted is not an arity error. Cleared
    callSignaturesWithOptionalParameters.
- T5: + rest-parameter shape lints (TS2370 / TS1014):
  - A rest parameter (`...x: T`) must be typed as an array, tuple, or
    `Array<T>` / `ReadonlyArray<T>` (or `any`). Otherwise emit
    "rest parameter must be of an array type".
  - A rest parameter must be the last positional parameter.
  - Caught on top-level functions, `declare function` imports, and
    class methods. Cleared `restParametersOfNonArrayTypes` and friends.

Per-directory breakdown (`recall_hit / recall_miss / precision_hit /
precision_miss`):

- `types/typeRelationships`: 32 / 137 / 77 / 17 — biggest single bucket
- `expressions/typeGuards`: 11 / 32 /  13 /  7
- `types/objectTypeLiteral`:  5 / 26 /  19 /  1
- `types/primitives`:         8 / 15 /   6 /  6
- `types/specifyingTypes`:    3 / 15 /   9 /  1
- `types/typeParameters`:    11 / 13 /  11 /  9
- `types/union`:              6 / 13 /   4 /  2
- `types/literal`:           12 / 12 /   7 / 13
- `types/tuple`:             11 / 11 /  10 /  1
- `controlFlow`:             13 / 10 /  25 /  7
- `types/typeAliases`:        2 /  9 /   3 /  1
- `types/contextualTypes`:    0 /  9 /   5 /  3
- `types/nonPrimitive`:       2 /  9 /   5 /  0

### Recall pushes (target: 29 % -> 40 %)

- [ ] Validate duplicate parameter names on functions / methods / call
  signatures. Covers `objectTypeLiteral/callSignatures/...DuplicateParameters`
  and similar method/interface variants (estimated 8-12 recall cases).
- [ ] Validate duplicate type-parameter names on functions / classes /
  interfaces / call signatures (`<T, T>`). Trivial detection; covers
  `typesWithDuplicateTypeParameters.ts` and friends (estimated 2-4
  cases).
- [ ] Detect self-constrained type parameters (`T extends T`,
  indirect cycles `T extends U, U extends T`). Covers
  `typeParameterDirectlyConstrainedToItself.ts` /
  `typeParameterIndirectlyConstrainedToItself.ts` (estimated 2-4 cases).
- [ ] Validate type-argument counts on call expressions, `new`
  expressions, and named type references. Covers
  `callNonGenericFunctionWithTypeArguments.ts`,
  `callGenericFunctionWithZeroTypeArguments.ts`,
  `instantiateGenericClassWithWrongNumberOfTypeArguments.ts`, etc.
  (estimated 10-15 recall cases across `typeArgumentLists/`).
- [ ] Run `is_assignable_to` on top-level and function-body `=`
  assignments (currently only used at call-site / declaration init).
  `typeRelationships/assignmentCompatibility/*` is dominated by
  `t = s;` patterns; this is the single biggest recall lever (137
  recall-miss cases share this directory).
- [ ] Static-property-init / definite-assignment-assertion checks on
  classes. `controlFlow/definiteAssignmentAssertions.ts` and class
  property cases.

### Precision pushes (target: 76 % false-positive rate -> reduce to <15 %)

- [ ] Treat method calls on unconstrained type parameters as `unknown`
  return rather than reporting "no such method". Fixes
  `propertyAccessOnTypeParameterWithoutConstraints.ts` and the related
  `WithConstraints*` variants (~3-5 false positives).
- [x] Handle negative numeric literal types (`var v: -123 = -123`) —
  `precise_literal_type` now narrows `UnaryOp(Neg, …)` to its negative
  literal type (commit `d5517a5`).
- [x] Non-strict null/undefined assignability: a literal `null` /
  `undefined` source assigns to any target (T3). Cleared the
  `expected X but got null` FP cluster (`nullAssignableToEveryType`,
  `objectTypesIdentityWithCallSignatures*`, etc.).
- [x] String-literal bracket access on primitives
  (`x["charAt"]`, `n["toExponential"]`, `b["toString"]`) reaches a
  prototype member by name — no longer flagged "cannot index into" /
  "is not callable" (T3). Cleared `stringPropertyAccess`,
  `numberPropertyAccess`, `booleanPropertyAccess`, and the
  `extend{String,Number,Boolean}Interface` cases.
- [ ] Computed property keys in `in`-operator narrowing
  (`const a = 'a'; if (a in c) { ... }`). False positives in
  `controlFlow/controlFlowInOperator.ts`.
- [ ] Contextual function-type inference for `T extends (x: string) =>
  string` constraints when the arg is a bare arrow without annotations.
  False positives in `functionConstraintSatisfaction3.ts` and
  `wrappedAndRecursiveConstraints{2,3}.ts`.

### Process

- Floors stay at recall >= 25 % and precision-miss <= 28 % until a
  batch lands; ratchet to recall >= 35 % and precision-miss <= 20 %
  after the first wave of recall improvements ships.
- Each batch commits per-directory breakdown numbers in the commit body
  so regressions can be triaged without rerunning the full corpus.
